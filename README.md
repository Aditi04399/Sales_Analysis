# Sales_Analysis
This project involves cleaning and preparing a raw sales dataset in Microsoft Excel that contains common real-world data issues such as missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent formatting, and outliers. The final goal is to transform the messy data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation.
